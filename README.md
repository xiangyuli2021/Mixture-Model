# Mixture-Model

•	Performed exploratory data analysis of 3-d data observations, such as exploration of univariate/bivariate empirical distributions and quantification of the dependence among the 3 features

•	Derived expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain a sequence of updated estimates for all model parameters and implemented this algorithm in Python using various feature combinations

•	Generated classification boundaries using all 3 pairwise feature dimensions and all 3 feature dimensions together assuming 3 regimes for the latent state

•	Applied the BIC criterion to determine the optimal number of hidden states
